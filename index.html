        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          Welcome to my software engineering portfolio! As a self-taught
          software engineer with 6 months of experience, I have been honing my
          skills in coding and software development. I am eager to continue
          learning and growing in this field, and to put my skills to work on
          real-world projects. In my brief time learning to code, I have gained
          experience with several programming languages, including HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript and some basic C#. I am passionate about using technology
          to solve problems and build innovative solutions, and I am constantly
          seeking out new challenges to help me grow as a developer. Take a look
          at my portfolio to see some of the projects I've been working on.
          Whether you're looking for a new software engineer to join your team,
          or just interested in what I'm up to, I hope you'll find something
          here that piques your interest. Thank you for visiting!

            <h3>Design and Development</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to learn how to code when I was 18 because of the
              exciting career opportunities in the tech industry, as well as the
              potential to work on personal projects and solve complex problems.
              I find coding to be a creative and intellectually challenging
              pursuit that allows me to bring my ideas to life.

              asset for me while pursuing a career in web development. This
              certification demonstrates my foundational knowledge in
              programming, databases, and web development - all of which are
              critical skills for a web developer. Additionally, the MTA
              certification is recognized by the industry, validating the my
              knowledge and skills. Therefore, having an MTA certification in
