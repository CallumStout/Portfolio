    <div id="about-me">
        <p>
            I am a .NET developer with a strong foundation in web development. 
            As I near the completion of an 18-month apprenticeship, I have gained hands-on experience in building robust and scalable applications using the .NET framework. 
            My apprenticeship has provided me with the opportunity to work on real-world projects, enhancing my technical skills and deepening my understanding of the software development lifecycle. 
            I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly solutions and am eager to continue growing my expertise in the field.
