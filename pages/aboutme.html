    <div id="about-me">
        <p>
            I started my career in software as a level 4 Software Engineering Apprentice - equivalent to the first year of a university degree or a HNC - 
            and achieved a Merit upon completion of the course. 
            I then progressed into a junior role, contributing to daily development projects in an Agile environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I have been actively engaged in both new and ongoing projects, contributing to their development and maintenance on a daily basis. 
            I adhere closely to agile methodologies, participating in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and code reviews to ensure effective collaboration and continuous delivery. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about continuous learning and take great satisfaction in solving real-world problems through code. 
            Whether refining various aspects of the software or enhancing user experience, my goal is to develop reliable and scalable solutions that deliver meaningful value.
